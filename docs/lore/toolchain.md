# Toolchain, environment and measurement lore

Moved verbatim out of `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-13 (§2 filesystem quirk, §3, §6 measurement lore, §8) so the file every
session loads stays small. `CLAUDE.md` keeps a short summary and the **same
numbering**, so an older citation such as "CLAUDE.md §6" or "CLAUDE.md
constraint 6" for this material resolves here. Keep adding to this file,
not back into `CLAUDE.md`.

## 3. Ground truth about the build — corrected

> **The face builds fine in a sandboxed Claude Code session.** Verified:
>
> ```
> $ monkeyc -f monkey.jungle -d fenix8solar47mm -o dash.prg -y ~/ciq/developer_key.der -w
> BUILD SUCCESSFUL
> ```

**The sibling project `~/claude/garmin-watchface-protomolecule/CLAUDE.md` claims
the opposite** — that `developer.garmin.com` is egress-blocked and the face
cannot be compiled in a sandbox. **Both claims are false** and were disproved in
this session (`docs/research/05-device-files.md` §1). That file has not been
corrected because the user asked to leave that repo untouched. Do not import its
build claims into this project.

Reference build commands:

```sh
export CIQ_SDK=~/ciq/sdks/9.2.0
$CIQ_SDK/bin/monkeyc -f monkey.jungle -d fenix8solar47mm \
    -o out.prg -y ~/ciq/developer_key.der -w -l 3 -O z
$CIQ_SDK/bin/monkeyc … --build-stats 0     # memory measurement
$CIQ_SDK/bin/connectiq                     # launch simulator (GUI)
$CIQ_SDK/bin/monkeydo out.prg fenix8solar47mm   # push to a RUNNING simulator
```

`monkeyc` runs fine on **OpenJDK 25**. No Java version pinning was needed.

### A filesystem quirk: tracked files can transiently vanish, harmlessly

Observed twice in one session, on different files each time (`wfb/
icon_catalog.py` once; `runtime-lib/WfbCache.mc` and `runtime-lib/
WfbWeather.mc` together another time; `tests/test_weather_barrel.py` and
`tests/test_weather_codegen.py` together a third): a file `git` correctly
tracks and has committed becomes briefly unreadable — `open()` on the exact
path raises `FileNotFoundError`, `os.listdir()` on its parent directory does
not list it, `import` of it fails — with `git status` then reporting it as
"deleted" even though nothing deleted it and no commit changed it. This is a
transient directory-entry/host-mount coherence issue in the sandbox, not
data loss: `git fsck` finds every affected object present and healthy every
time this happened, and the fix is always the same one-liner:

```sh
git checkout HEAD -- <path>
```

**Do this before assuming a file is genuinely gone or a commit is broken.**
It has never once actually been gone. If `git status` shows a file deleted
that you did not delete and have no reason to believe was deleted, restore
it this way and move on — do not investigate further, do not treat it as
evidence of a bad commit or a corrupted checkout, and do not skip a step
that depends on the file being there just because one check caught it mid-
glitch.

## Measurement / build lore (formerly §6 "Hard-won facts")

**Measurement / build lore:**

- **A `.prg`'s size depends on the path it was built at.** Identical
  generated source built to two output directories whose names differ in
  length produced files 80 B apart, with `source/` byte-identical under
  `diff -r` — not non-determinism (eight runs at one fixed path are
  byte-stable), a dependency on an input nobody thinks of as one, because a
  `.prg` embeds the paths it was built from. This has already invalidated
  two agents' reported memory-cost numbers in one session. **Prefer
  `--build-stats`** (deterministic, and the only figure that counts against
  the 128 KB budget) for anything emitted as code; take file-size
  comparisons only at equal-length paths, and only for costs
  `--build-stats` cannot see (a resource like a baked font).
- Compiling a `<watchface-config>` makes this SDK's JVM print a four-line
  `sun.misc.Unsafe` notice using `monkeyc`'s own bare `WARNING:` prefix.
  `wfb/build.py` strips exactly that line shape and nothing else — this is
  the one thing that could silently defeat this project's warning-free bar,
  so it is driven red both ways (a real warning must still surface; the
  notice must not).
- A Styles config entry costs about 9 B data, 28 B code, ~61 B of `.prg` —
  so a Styles cross-product (several `color_scheme:`s, say) is a UX cost to
  weigh, never a memory one.

## 8. Useful SDK paths

Everything below is offline inside `$CIQ_SDK` — **prefer it over the website**,
it is version-pinned to the SDK.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `doc/docs/Core_Topics/` | Complications, Editing_Watch_Faces_On_Device, Graphics, Layouts, Resources, Build_Configuration, Manifest_and_Permissions, Unit_Testing |
| `doc/docs/Connect_IQ_FAQ/` | AMOLED, Optimize_Bitmaps, Custom_Fonts, Update_Every_Second |
| `doc/docs/Reference_Guides/Jungle_Reference.html` | the jungle build language (the generator emits these) |
| `doc/docs/Device_Reference/*.html` | 164 devices: screen, memory limits, **per-language font pixel metrics** |
| `doc/Toybox/**` | full API docs incl. per-method "Supported Devices" |
| `bin/api.debug.xml` | SDK-wide symbol table |
| `bin/resources.xsd` | XSD for all resource XML — validate generated XML against it |
| `samples/` | 44 samples; `ConfigurableWatchFace`, `Analog`, `TrueTypeFonts` are the relevant ones |

`tools/research/h2t.py` converts the SDK's HTML docs to greppable text — the
fastest way to search them.

## 2. Environment setup — do this first

The environment is **not** in the repo. Rebuild it with:

```sh
./tools/setup-env.sh
```

That script downloads the SDK, generates a developer key, and installs the
device definitions. What it sets up, and why each part matters:

| Piece | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Connect IQ SDK 9.2.0 | `~/ciq/sdks/9.2.0` | Downloaded unauthenticated from `developer.garmin.com`. 204 MB. |
| Developer key | `~/ciq/developer_key.der` | Plain OpenSSL RSA → PKCS#8 DER. No Garmin tooling needed. |
| **Device definitions** | `~/.Garmin/ConnectIQ/Devices/` | **Cannot be downloaded.** See below. |
| Env vars | `/etc/sandbox-persistent.sh` | `CIQ_SDK`, and SDK `bin/` on `PATH`. |
| Python venv | `.venv/` | `ruamel.yaml`, `jsonschema`, `pillow`, `fonttools`, `pytest`. |

On Debian/Ubuntu, `python3 -m venv` needs `python3-venv` installed separately;
the script says so and falls back to `uv venv` when `uv` is available.

### The one thing that is genuinely gated: device definitions

The SDK zip contains the compiler, simulator and docs but **no device files**.
They are fetched by the SDK Manager from
`https://api.gcs.garmin.com/ciq-product-onboarding/devices`, which returns
**HTTP 401** — it needs a Garmin SSO login that cannot be completed headlessly.
(`monkeynet.garmin.com`, also referenced by the SDK Manager, does not resolve
publicly.)

Without them every device-targeted build fails with:

```
ERROR: Invalid device id specified: 'fenix8solar47mm'
```

**They are already vendored** at `vendor/devices/` (copied from the user's macOS
host, `~/Library/Application Support/Garmin/ConnectIQ/Devices/`). 9 devices,
21 MB, including all three targets. `setup-env.sh` installs them.

`vendor/devices/` is **gitignored on purpose** — it is the user's own licensed
copy of Garmin's device files, fine to move around their machine but not
something to commit as redistributable. It therefore travels with the *packaged
directory*, not with the git history. If you restore this repo from a git bundle
alone, the device files will be missing and `setup-env.sh` will tell you so.

If they are ever missing, ask the user to run on their **host**:

```sh
cp -R ~/Library/Application\ Support/Garmin/ConnectIQ/Devices \
      ~/claude/garmin-watchface-protomolecule/.devices-import
```

### Known-good reference

`~/claude/garmin-watchface-protomolecule/` is a **working, dense, real** watch
face for the same targets. It builds. Use it as:

- a **validation target** — "can the schema express Dashboard?";
- a source of proven idioms — `source/Data.mc` (refresh tiers, `has` guards),
  `source/Arcs.mc` (pen-width arcs), `source/Icons.mc` (drawn primitives),
  `tools/preview.py` (a 694-line MIP preview renderer worth partially porting).

Treat it as **read-only**. The user asked for it to be left untouched. Note it is
not present in a fresh sandbox — it lives on the user's host.
